# 311-Project1
A project involving implementing, measuring, and comparing some basic sorting algorithms.

The project was originally supposed to be written from scratch, as was the report.
After we finished, our professor determined it would take too long to grade the reports, and had us redo the project using a template.

The purpose was to familiarize us with the implementation of different sorting algorithms, and understand the pros and cons of each.

main.cpp contains the code solution, although it is slightly different from my original solution.
My original outputted the measured times into a .csv file called timesOut, which is included in this repository.
This was to smooth the process of importing the data to google sheets in order to quickly plot graphs.

Project1_Fall2021.pdf is the final product, after the change to a template.

Project_1_311.pdf is the original report I wrote, using my original code. I included this because I am more proud of it than the actual final product.

project_1.cpp is the original code solution. We were permitted to discuss and brainstorm with classmates, provided we add their names at the top.
The lines that output to timesOut.csv are not included. I did not have the foresight to make them separate and deleted the file outputs in place of terminal output.
